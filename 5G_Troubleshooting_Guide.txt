5G TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
------------------------

1. Radio Issues
   - Check RSRP/RSRQ/SINR levels.
   - Validate gNB configuration and PCI collisions.
   - Verify UE RF capability and antenna alignment.

2. Core Network Issues
   - Check AMF/SMF/NSSF logs for registration failures.
   - Validate UPF reachability and PFCP session setup.
   - Inspect N2/N3 interface connectivity.

3. Mobility Issues
   - Analyze Handover Success Rate.
   - Check Xn and N2 handover logs.
   - Evaluate TAC and tracking area mismatch problems.

4. KPI Degradation
   - Monitor accessibility, retainability, and mobility KPIs.
   - Check system load, CPU utilization, and memory leaks.

5. Throughput Issues
   - Validate user plane routing.
   - Check QoS and slicing configuration.
   - Confirm correct bandwidth part (BWP) behavior.

6. Call Drops
   - Inspect RRC re-establishment causes.
   - Look for Layer 2 retransmissions and HARQ failures.

7. VoNR Issues
   - Validate EPS fallback behavior.
   - Inspect IMS registration and SIP signaling.
